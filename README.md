# FODMAP Detector

A Go CLI tool that processes Yelp dataset reviews to identify FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) content in food items. Designed to help people with digestive sensitivities by analyzing restaurant reviews for dish ingredients and flagging FODMAP groups.

---

## Purpose

1. Read Yelp review data from a compressed archive (`.tar.gz` of JSON lines)
2. Serialize reviews to Apache Avro (streaming) or Apache Parquet (columnar batch) formats
3. Run LLM-based FODMAP analysis on review text using Google Gemini

## Core Data Model

Reviews reference businesses by ID only. The business name and location metadata live in a separate dataset file.

```go
// Review holds a single review record. BusinessID is a foreign key into the business dataset —
// the business name is NOT present here.
type Review struct {
    ReviewID   string  // Yelp review ID
    UserID     string  // Reviewer user ID
    BusinessID string  // Foreign key — look up name/location in Business
    Stars      float32 // Rating (1-5)
    Useful     int32   // Usefulness votes
    Funny      int32   // Funny votes
    Cool       int32   // Cool votes
    Text       string  // Full review text
}

// Business holds metadata from yelp_academic_dataset_business.json.
// Required to resolve a BusinessID to a human-readable name.
type Business struct {
    BusinessID string // Primary key, matches Review.BusinessID
    Name       string // Human-readable restaurant/business name
    City       string
    State      string
    Categories string // Comma-separated, e.g. "Italian, Pizza, Restaurants"
}
```

The Avro streaming schema (`EventSchema`) mirrors the `Review` struct and carries `business_id` but not the business name. During indexing, the name is joined from the business dataset and stored in Weaviate so search results include it directly.

## Running

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Engine** with the Compose plugin. On Ubuntu, if `docker compose` is not found:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install docker-compose-v2
  ```
- **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** — required to start the HTTP server (used by the `/analyze` endpoint). Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey):
  ```sh
  export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  ```

### 1. Start Weaviate (required for search)

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Weaviate on port `8090` and the `text2vec-transformers` inference sidecar.
On first run, the transformer model (~90 MB) is downloaded automatically. Wait for:

```
t2v-transformers  | Application startup complete.
```

### 2. Index reviews into Weaviate

```sh
go run ./cmd/cli index --weaviate localhost:8090
```

This reads the full Yelp archive, joins reviews with business metadata (city, state, categories),
and upserts them to Weaviate in batches of 500 using 4 concurrent upload workers. The command is
idempotent — safe to re-run. A checkpoint file (`index.checkpoint`) is written after each batch so
an interrupted run resumes from where it left off rather than starting over.

```sh
# Custom tuning
go run ./cmd/cli index --weaviate localhost:8090 --batch-size 1000 --workers 8

# Resume from a specific checkpoint file
go run ./cmd/cli index --checkpoint /tmp/my.checkpoint

# Point to a different archive
go run ./cmd/cli index --archive /data/yelp_dataset.tar

# Disable checkpointing
go run ./cmd/cli index --checkpoint ""

# Start from a known offset (e.g. after processing 2,155,100 reviews)
go run ./cmd/cli index --start-offset 2155100
```

### 3. Start the HTTP server

`GEMINI_API_KEY` must be set in the environment before starting.

```sh
# With search enabled
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key go run . serve --weaviate localhost:8090

# Without search (search endpoint returns 503)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key go run . serve
```

Default port is `8080`. Default prompt path is `./prompt.txt`.

#### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/analyze` | Submit reviews for FODMAP analysis (returns job ID) |
| `GET` | `/results/{job_id}` | Poll analysis results |
| `GET` | `/reviews` | List reviews for a business |
| `GET` | `/search/{query...}` | Semantic restaurant search (requires Weaviate) |

#### Search endpoint

Find restaurants matching a natural-language description:

```sh
# Basic search — returns top 10 businesses by relevance
curl "localhost:8080/search/cozy%20Italian%20with%20great%20pasta"

# Filter by category
curl "localhost:8080/search/best%20tacos?category=Mexican"

# Filter by city and state
curl "localhost:8080/search/romantic%20dinner?city=Las%20Vegas&state=NV"

# Combine all filters with a custom limit
curl "localhost:8080/search/outdoor%20patio%20brunch?category=Breakfast&city=Phoenix&state=AZ&limit=5"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "businesses": [
    {"id": "abc123", "name": "Joe's Diner"},
    {"id": "def456", "name": "Pasta Palace"},
    {"id": "ghi789", "name": "Taco Town"}
  ]
}
```

Business IDs are ranked by **Top-K average similarity** — the average of the top 5 most relevant
reviews per restaurant. This avoids both volume bias (popular chains don't dominate) and outlier
noise (one lucky review can't carry a poor fit).

See [docs/search.md](docs/search.md) for full API reference and design decisions.

### CLI

Run the CLI with:

```sh
go run ./cmd/cli

## Input Data

Place the Yelp dataset archive at:

```
./data/archive.tar.gz
```

The archive must contain files whose names include `"review"` and `"business"`:
- `yelp_academic_dataset_review.json` — review text and ratings (required for all features)
- `yelp_academic_dataset_business.json` — business name, city, state, categories (required for search filters)

Both files must be formatted as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL).
